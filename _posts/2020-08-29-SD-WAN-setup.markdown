In this post, we will go through all the steps of how to configure the CISCO SD-WAN lab in 
GNS3. This includes of two main parts: 
- Setting up the Initial Topology for the control plane devices: vManage, vBond, and vSmart.
- Extend the initial lab by adding some more sites.

There are some excellent resources that I have learned a lot from when I tried to set up
this lab:

## 1. Software/hardware requirements and initial topology

### 1.1. Lab Software

- GNS3 version 2.2.12
- VMwareÂ® Workstation 15 Pro
- vManage - 20.3.1
- vBond and vEdge - 20.3.1
- vSmart - 20.3.1
- vEdge - 20.3.1

### 1.2. Hardware requirements
I have the Dell Desktop XPS 8390 with 32GB RAM 12vCPUs and allocate 16GB RAM and
 8 vCPUs for the GNS3 VM to spin up this basic SD-WAN lab. In this lab: 
- vManage is 12 GB RAM, 2 vCPUs, 30 GB storage; 
- vSmart is 4 GB RAM, 1 vCPU, no required storage; 
- vBond is 2GB RAM, 1 vCPU, no required storage. 

The other nodes: 
- Border Router: CSR1000v - 3GB RAM, 1 vCPU; 
- 2 vEdges router: 2 GB RAM and 1 vCPU each. 

When the full lab is  running the gsn3 VM CPU 28.5%; RAM 85.9%. 

### 1.3. Initial Topology 

The initial topology in GNS3 is as in the figure below.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/03_SD-WAN/00_Setup/images/00_lab_topology.png" %}

We set up the topology with the following details in mind.

- Networks in host machine, created by VMware:
  - Host-only: VMnet1 - 192.168.134.0/24
  - NAT: VMnet8 - 192.168.100.0/24

We need to group the interfaces into 2 different VPNs: VPN 0 for control and VPN 512 for 
management.

| Host    | VPN 512 (mgmt)       | VPN 0 (control)                                   |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| vManage | eth0 - 172.16.1.1/24 | eth1 - 10.10.1.1/24;<br>eth2 - 192.168.134.138/24 |
| vSmart  | eth0 - 172.16.1.2/24 | eth1 - 10.10.1.2/24                               |
| vBond   | eth0 - 172.16.1.3/24 | Ge0/0 - 10.10.1.3/24                              |

Note that, vManage has `eth2` that connects it with the host machine through VMnet8, so that
we can connect to the vManage web interface using the IP address: 192.168.134.138.

### 1.4. Viptela CLI modes
There are two cli modes in Viptela device software: `viptela-cli` and `vshell`. When you 
login to a Viptela device terminal, you are placed  in the `viptela-cli` mode. To enter 
the `vshell` mode, using the command  `vshell`, and `exit` to return back to `viptela-cli` 
mode.
 
```bash
vmanage# vshell
vmanage:~$ exit
exit
vmanage# 
```

You can find the best sdwan command cheatsheet [here](https://codingpackets.com/blog/cisco-sdwan-command-comparison-cheat-sheet/).

## 2. Control plane devices configuration
In this lab, we will start by configuring the root CA. The root CA is configured in the vManage
device to simplify the topology. Next we move onto installing certificate on each Viptela 
device, including vManage, vBond, vSmart.

### 2.1. vManage
#### Boostrap configuration
We need to spin up vManage in GNS3. During this step, we can set up the user and password to 
log into vManage (`admin/admin`) and configure the boostrap configuration in configuration mode
`conf t`.

```bash
system
 host-name             vmanage
 system-ip             1.1.1.1
 site-id               1000
 admin-tech-on-failure
 sp-organization-name  SD-WAN-DOANH
 organization-name     SD-WAN-DOANH
 vbond 10.10.1.3
vpn 0
 interface eth1
  ip address 10.10.1.1/24
  tunnel-interface
  !
  no shutdown
 !
 interface eth2
  ip dhcp-client
  no shutdown
 !
 ip route 0.0.0.0/0 10.10.1.254
!
vpn 512
 interface eth0
  ip address 172.16.1.1/24
  no shutdown
 !
!
```

Note that, IP address of `eth2` is assigned by the DHCP server of VMnet8. To check using 
`sh int | tab`.

Now, we can access the vManage web interface with a web browser at `https://192.168.134.138:8444/`.
Then we need to set the Organization name and vBond IP address in vManage Web Interface.

Going to `Administration > Settings` and set the organization name and vBond as in the figure 
below.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/03_SD-WAN/00_Setup/images/00_organization_name.png" %}

#### Configure root CA in vManage
To configure the Certificate Authority in vManage, generate key and certificate. In vManage 
`vshell` mode:
```bash
openssl genrsa -out SDWAN.key 2048
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key SDWAN.key -sha256 -days 2000 \
        -subj "/C=UK/ST=LD/L=LD/O=SD-WAN-DOANH/CN=SD-WAN" \
        -out SDWAN.pem
ls
cat SDWAN.pem
```

Copy `SDWAN.pem` content to `Administration > Settings > Controller Certification 
Authorization > Enterprise Root Certificate`.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/03_SD-WAN/00_Setup/images/01_SDWAN-pem.png" %}

{% include figure image_path="/assets/03_SD-WAN/00_Setup/images/02_controller-certificate-authorization-2.png" %}

From the browser, go to 
https://192.168.134.138/dataservice/system/device/sync/rootcertchain to request a 
resync of the vManage database via API call. The answer in JSON format 
should be: `{"syncRootCertChain":"done"}`.

#### Install the certificate
We need to create Certificate Signing Request (CSR) in vManage Web interface: 
`Configuration > Certificates > Controllers > Generate CSR`.

Copy the CSR content, go back to vManage `vshell` mode, create an empty file vManage.csr with
`vim vManage.csr`, then paste the copied content to this file, save it.

Sign the vManage.csr with the CA certificate and key using openssl:

```bash
openssl x509 -req -in vManage.csr -CA SDWAN.pem -CAkey SDWAN.key -CAcreateserial -out vManage.crt -days 2000 -sha256
ls
cat vManage.crt
```

Copy the content of vManage.crt and install the certificate at vManage web interface
`Configuration > Certificates > Controllers > Select vManage > Install Certificate`.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/03_SD-WAN/00_Setup/images/03_vManage-crt-install.png" %}

Successful certificate install log:

{% include figure image_path="/assets/03_SD-WAN/00_Setup/images/03_vManage-crt-success.png" %}

### 2.2. Adding vBond controller
#### Boostrap configuration
First, we spin up vBond in GNS3. During this step, we can set up the user and password to 
log into vBond (`admin/admin`) and configure the boostrap configuration in configuration mode
`conf t`.

```bash
system
 host-name               vbond
 system-ip               1.1.1.3
 site-id                 1000
 admin-tech-on-failure
 no route-consistency-check
 organization-name       SD-WAN-DOANH
 vbond 10.10.1.3 local vbond-only
vpn 0
 interface ge0/0
  ip address 10.10.1.3/24
  ipv6 dhcp-client
  tunnel-interface
   encapsulation ipsec
  !
  no shutdown
 !
 ip route 0.0.0.0/0 10.10.1.254
!
vpn 512
 interface eth0
  ip address 172.16.1.3/24
  no shutdown
 !
!
```

#### Install the certificate
Now, we need to copy the SDWAN.pem and SDWAN.key from vManage to vBond and use them to authenticate
vBond with vManage. Go to vManage `vshell` mode, use `cat SDWAN.pem` and `cat SDWAN.key`, then 
copy the content of these two files.

In vBond `vshell` mode, paste the content of SDWAN.pem and SDWAN.key from vManage in the two
empty files SDWAN.pem and SDWAN.key with `vim` command.
```bash
vim SDWAN.pem
vim SDWAN.key
```

Now, we need to add the vBond controller in vManage web interface 
 `Configuration > Devices > Controllers > Add Controller`.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/03_SD-WAN/00_Setup/images/04-add-vBond.png" %}

{% include figure image_path="/assets/03_SD-WAN/00_Setup/images/04-add-vBond-2.png" %}

 
View the CSR at `Configuration > Certificates > Controller > vBond > View CSR`
- Copy the content of the CSR
- Go back to vBond `vshell` mode and paste to the new empty file vBond.csr with
   `vim vBonds.csr`
  
{% include figure image_path="/assets/03_SD-WAN/00_Setup/images/04-view-vBond-CSR.png" %}

Sign vBond.csr using openssl and generate vBond.crt

```bash
openssl x509 -req -in vBond.csr -CA SDWAN.pem -CAkey SDWAN.key -CAcreateserial -out vBond.crt -days 2000 -sha256
cat vBond.crt
```

Copy the content of vBond.crt and install the certificate at vManage web interface
`Configuration > Certificates > Controllers > Select vBond > Install Certificate`.

### 2.3. Adding vSmart controller
#### Boostrap configuration
```bash
system
 host-name             vsmart
 system-ip             1.1.1.2
 site-id               1000
 admin-tech-on-failure
 organization-name     SD-WAN-DOANH
 vbond 10.10.1.3
vpn 0
 interface eth1
  ip address 10.10.1.2/24
  tunnel-interface
  !
  no shutdown
 !
 ip route 0.0.0.0/0 10.10.1.254
!
vpn 512
 interface eth0
  ip address 172.16.1.2/24
  no shutdown
 !
!
```
#### Install the certificate
In vSmart `vshell` mode, paste the content of SDWAN.pem and SDWAN.key from vManage

```bash
vim SDWAN.pem
vim SDWAN.key
```

Add the vSmart controller in vManage web interface at 
`Configuration > Devices > Controllers > Add Controller`.

View the CSR at `Configuration > Certificates > Controller > vSmart > View CSR`
- Copy the content of the CSR
- Go back to vSmart `vshell` mode and paste to vSmart.csr

Sign vSmart.csr using openssl and generate vSmart.crt
```bash
openssl x509 -req -in vSmart.csr -CA SDWAN.pem -CAkey SDWAN.key -CAcreateserial -out vSmart.crt -days 2000 -sha256
cat vSmart.crt
```

Copy the content of vSmart.crt and install the certificate at vManage web interface
`Configuration > Certificates > Controllers > Select vSmart > Install Certificate`.

## 3. Extend initial topology with more sites
### 3.1. Extend topology
The extended topology is as in the following figure.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/03_SD-WAN/00_Setup/images/08_extend_topo.png" %}

### 3.2. Adding Border Router
```bash
hostname R1
interface GigabitEthernet1
 ip address 10.10.1.254 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
!
interface GigabitEthernet2
 ip address 172.19.0.1 255.255.0.0
 no shutdown
!
interface GigabitEthernet3
 ip address 172.18.0.1 255.255.0.0
 no shutdown
!
```
### 3.3. Upload the WAN Edge list
At this step, we will need an valid WAN Edge List. You can go to the 
[poc::v:lab](https://pocvlab.com/cisco-sd-wan-vedges-licensing-and-onboarding/) site for 
more information of how to get this list.

Go to `Configuration > Devices` and click `Upload WAN Edge List`. 

{% include figure image_path="/assets/03_SD-WAN/00_Setup/images/06_edge_list.png" %}

After uploading the WAN Edge List, youâll see your devices in `Configuration > Devices`.  

You will need to valid the edge device by going to `Configuration > Certifcates > WAN Edge List`
 and click `valid` under the `Validate` column.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/03_SD-WAN/00_Setup/images/06_edge_valid.png" %}

### 3.4. Adding vEdge1 node
#### Bootstrap configuration
We will add vEdge1 of site-id 1 to the topology. The boostrap configuration is as follows:
```bash
system
 host-name               vEdge1
 system-ip               2.2.2.1
 site-id                 1
 admin-tech-on-failure
 no route-consistency-check
 organization-name       SD-WAN-DOANH
 vbond 10.10.1.3
vpn 0
 interface ge0/0
  ip address 172.19.0.11/16
  ipv6 dhcp-client
  tunnel-interface
   encapsulation ipsec
  !
  no shutdown
 !
 interface ge0/1
  ip address 172.18.0.11/16
  no shutdown
 !
 ip route 0.0.0.0/0 172.19.0.1
!
```
#### Install the certificate
We will need to copy the content of SDWAN.pem from vManage to vEdge1. In vEdge1, 
go to `vshell` mode, create an empty file with `vim SDWAN.pem`, then paste the copied content,
`exit` to return back to the `viptela-cli` mode.

```bash
vEdge1# vshell
vEdge1:~$ vim SDWAN.pem
vEdge1:~$ exit         
vEdge1# 
```
Now, we can import the certificate.
```bash
request root-cert-chain install /home/admin/SDWAN.pem
```

Go to vManage interface, `Configuration > Devices > Select unused entry > ... > Generate Bootstrap
Configuration`, to see the boostrap information, what we need is the UUID and token to be used
in the next command. Note that, since we use `vEdge`, the `unused entry` we select needs to 
be of model `vEdge Cloud`.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/03_SD-WAN/00_Setup/images/05_generate_bootstrap_configuration.png" %}

```bash
request vedge-cloud activate chassis-number uuid token otp
```
One example is as follows:
```bash
request vedge-cloud activate chassis-number 26e25eef-2ec0-94e4-5b6e-d3512f8ca2fb token 5726ba8c152b416eb804be6ba150cf30
```

Check with `show control local-properties`.
### 3.5. Adding vEdge3 node
#### Boostrap configuration
```bash
system
 host-name               vEdge3
 system-ip               2.2.2.3
 site-id                 3
 admin-tech-on-failure
 no route-consistency-check
 organization-name       SD-WAN-DOANH
 vbond 10.10.1.3
vpn 0
 interface ge0/0
  ip address 172.19.0.31/16
  ipv6 dhcp-client
  tunnel-interface
   encapsulation ipsec
  !
  no shutdown
 !
 interface ge0/1
  ip address 172.18.0.31/16
  no shutdown
 !
 ip route 0.0.0.0/0 172.19.0.1
!
vpn 512
 interface eth0
  ip dhcp-client
  ipv6 dhcp-client
  no shutdown
 !
!
```
#### Install the certificate
Repeat the same process as with vEdge1:

```bash
request root-cert-chain install /home/admin/SDWAN.pem
request vedge-cloud activate chassis-number 5997295d-c718-3109-6277-08b4caea2bcf token 764fa250066c4e90bb994ce60994bf90
```

Verify by going to `Monitor > Network`, note that there are two more vEdges that have been
recognized by vManage.

## 4. Conclusion

In this lab, we went through all the steps to configure the basic SD-WAN in GNS3. Now, everything
is up and running. Let's grab an SD-WAN book, study hard, and check the knowledge with this lab.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/03_SD-WAN/00_Setup/images/07_RG.png" %}
