I am having a passion for Network Automation and DevNet. Since I want to lab every day in 
GNS3 or EVE-NG, I am committed to automating all of the repetitive tasks such as interfaces 
configuration, OSPF, EIGRP, BGP routing configurations. I watched the training material from
 the well-known Khawar Butt (that is available on [RouterGods YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/routergods/videos)) to be sure 
 about the best practices. I followed along with his videos and rebuilt the labs in EVE-NG. 
 However, when he brought up the lab with the interfaces already configured (like ten 
 interfaces, including Loopbacks), I didnâ€™t want to configure that manually, imagine to do the 
 same for ten routers.

So, I decided to build a CLI tool powered by Nornir 3.0. This practice will help me not only 
in fastening the process of spinning up the lab but also in learning Nornir 3.0.

The CLI tool named `fastcli`. I posted it on Twitter, submitted it to DevNet CodeExchange, 
and people are kind of like it.

The examples of the topologies for configurations in this exercise are as follows:
- [Topology 1: BGP configuration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MWqCyInQ94)
- [Topology 2: OSPF, EIGRP, RIP configuration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kak2pe0LSWQ&t=16638s)

## 1. Fastcli - A tool for network configuration - Nornir 3.0

You can find the original code on my GitHub repo [fastcli](https://github.com/kimdoanh89/fastcli).

This public repo contains python codes of a CLI tool, called `fastcli`, for automatically generation of configuration commands and send these commands to the network. The current version supports the commands for interfaces configuration, OSPF, EIGRP, RIP and BGP configurations. 

The environment is pre-configured for setting the BGP configuration of topology 1, under `inventory/bgp` folder.
You can change the topology to be configured by change the variable in the `constants.py` file.

```python
config_file = "inventory/bgp/config.yaml"
```

A zip file `EVE-NG-topologies.zip` that contains 2 network topologies for testing purpose is attached.

### 1.1. Initializing Nornir and Inventory
The `inventory/bgp` folder contains the following files described the desired state of the network, including:
- config.yaml
- defaults.yaml
- groups.yaml
- hosts.yaml

There is the tutorial from Nornir website that we need to understand about [initializing Nornir](https://nornir.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/initializing_nornir.html), [inventory](https://nornir.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/inventory.html).

### 1.2. Fastcli workflow
The workflow is:
- Defined the configuration information in `hosts.yaml`, including:
  - List of interfaces and IP addresses of each device
  - OSPF, BGP, EIGRP information
- Run the configuration command `fastcli interfaces configure`, or `fastcli bgp configure`.
- Commands will be automatically generated and sent to each device.
- Confirm the configuration with `fastcli show facts --command "sh ip int br"`, 
or `fastcli show facts --command "sh ip bgp"`.

### 1.3. Some commands supported

## 2. Requirements and Setup

### 2.1. Requirements
To use this code you will need:

- Python 3.8+
- A network with SSH connection setup of all devices.

### 2.2. Install and Setup
Clone the code to local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kimdoanh89/fastcli
cd fastcli
```

Setup Python Virtual Environment (requires Python 3.8+)
```bash
python3.8 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --editable .
```

The variable `config_file` in `constants.py` file needs to be configured before running depends on where you
keep your config file.

## 3. Example topologies

### 3.1. Topology 1: BGP configuration

{% include figure image_path="/assets/04_fastcli/images/00_topo2.png" %}
